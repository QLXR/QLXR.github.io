After chatting with Dev and lots people, this is what I find out. 

![Screen_shot_kills](/assets/img/killscount.png)
_summary of data ( fight with TM )_

we have `107` kills captured in ARC DPS

my gw2 efficiency/gw2 mists shows `285` kills for that night

and i got 2 Emblem of the Avenger , `200+`

here is a simple explain:

`285`=`107`+`80`+`98` :
- `107`  this is what Anet released data(ARC DPS captured it) ,  from Squad view, it only counts squad member(Myst) kill blows. it does not count if people out side squad(TM) make kills. 
- `80` this is when squad downed enemy, but not confirmed kills,  TM squad confirmed the kills.
- `98` this is when you give buffs/heals to people(squad and outside squad) who confirmed kills

Summary:
right now, Anet only open limited data to ARCDPS, so which means, ARCDPS can only record from Squad review of how many kills confirmed(kill blow), not on the battle field view. 
While the achievement count from Anet also controversial, because it also include if you heal/buff some one outside squad that makes the kills.  

PS: may be we should just use `downs 234` to calculate KDR, more close to actual data.
